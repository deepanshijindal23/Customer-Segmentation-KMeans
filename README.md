A Machine Learning project that segments customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending behavior. This helps businesses understand customer patterns and improve marketing strategies.

📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a key technique in marketing analytics.
In this project, we use K-Means Clustering to group customers into meaningful clusters such as:

High spenders

Budget customers

Careless buyers

Standard customers

Target customers

The results are visualized using a color-coded scatter plot for easy interpretation.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains customer details like:

Annual Income

Spending Score

It is commonly used for unsupervised learning and clustering demonstrations.
